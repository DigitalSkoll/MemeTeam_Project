> 1. Design your Console user interface using the appropriate layout and screen 
>    placement to be efficient and effective for the operator grading the 
>    examinations. Your project MUST include a Menu with AT LEAST these options.

> 2. *Option 1:* The DMV examiner will use the KEYBOARD (and the 'C' scanf() function)
>		 to enter the FILENAME containing each driver license applicant's exam answers
> 	 (Hint: Place ALL data files into a Folder named Datafiles located in the same
>		 directory as the project's executable (.exe) and source code (.asm) files. That
> 	 will make the 'path' to those files easier to specift in your program code by 
>		 simply using ".\\Datafiles\\" + the concatenated string FILENAME value entered
>		 by the DMV examiner in Menu Option 1). Make appropriate SCREEN CAPTURES as the 
>		 application is running to demonstrate functionality of your final Menu design 
> 	 and this option's operation.
> 3. *Option 3:* The completed DMV examination grading application will perform the
> 	 following operations.
